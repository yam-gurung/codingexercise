Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub 
Go to your GitHub account Developer settings in a web browser: https://github.com/settings/tokens.
Click the Generate new token button and select Generate new token (classic).
Give the token a descriptive name (e.g., "Eclipse Token").
Set an expiration for the token.
Select the necessary scopes or permissions for the token. At a minimum, check the repo box for full control of private repositories.
Click Generate token.
Copy the generated token immediately. For security, you will not be able to see it again.

when performing a Git action (like Fetch or Push) that prompts for credentials, 
enter your GitHub username and the Personal Access Token as the password, and 
ensure you check the option to save it in the secure store.
